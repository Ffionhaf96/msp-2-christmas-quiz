## Project Development & Planning
The development of "The Christmas Quiz" was a meticulous process guided by the principles of UX design, including the 5 planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton & Surface. Each stage was carefully executed to create an application that is not only engaging and fun but also intuitive and accessible, fulfilling the needs and expectations of both users and clients.

### Project Goals

#### **Project Purpose**
The Christmas Quiz is a multifaceted project with the primary aim of blending education with entertainment.

The project is a harmonious fusion of engaging content, educational value, and user-centric design, catering to a wide range of users while fulfilling specific educational objectives.


#### **Client Goals**
Although "The Christmas Quiz" was developed as a milestone project for my Diploma in Web Application Development at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), focusing on interactive frontend development and marking my first foray into JavaScript, it did not have a specific external client. To enhance the professionalism of the project and establish a clear scope, I envisioned it as a real-world application that could be ideally suited for festive season promotions, possibly by a family entertainment center, holiday event organizer, or a Christmas-themed website. The hypothetical client's goals would include:
* Engaging users with interactive and enjoyable content related to the Christmas season.
* Educating users about various Christmas traditions, history, and fun facts through an interactive quiz format.
* Enhancing the festive experience of their website visitors, contributing to the holiday spirit.
* Providing a platform that could potentially be used for festive marketing or promotional activities, attracting a wide audience during the holiday season.

#### **User Goals**

The primary audience for "The Christmas Quiz" includes individuals and families who are interested in festive entertainment and eager to learn about Christmas traditions, history, and trivia. This quiz is designed to appeal to a broad range of users, from children to adults, who wish to engage in holiday spirit in an interactive and educational manner. User Goals are:

- **Enhancing Knowledge**: Users aim to increase their understanding of Christmas traditions, history, and interesting facts from various cultures.

### Content
The Christmas Quiz consists of 10 engaging questions, each with multiple-choice answers. The answers are associated with different aspects of Christmas, such as traditions, historical facts, festive foods, and more. The categories include:

* Christmas Traditions
* Historical Facts
* Festive Foods
* Christmas Movies
* Christmas Music

As users progress through the quiz, their answers help to build a festive profile. At the end of the quiz, these results are summarized and presented to the user, showing which aspects of Christmas they are most aligned with. This could be in the form of their knowledge of Christmas traditions, a preference for festive foods, or an affinity for Christmas music, for example.

To enhance the fun and engaging nature of the quiz, the results might also include a suggestion of a Christmas-themed activity or recipe that matches their profile. Possible suggestions could include:

### Design, Layout & Structure
#### **Wireframes**

I chose to create detailed wireframes for "The Christmas Quiz" using diagrams.net, focusing on the structure, skeleton, and layout, as well as the overall style and appearance of the site. This approach allowed me to make critical design decisions regarding colors, fonts, and layout before starting the coding process. The wireframes were developed for desktop, tablet, and mobile views to ensure that responsiveness was a key consideration from the start.

<details><summary>Welcome Screen</summary>

#### **Structure**

The structure of "The Christmas Quiz" website is meticulously designed, considering the scope, user and business goals, as well as adhering to the principles of Interaction Design (IXD) to ensure an intuitive user experience.

The site maintains a straightforward structure, with all content, except for a custom 404 error page, contained within a single web page (index.html). The content dynamically changes via JavaScript based on the user's interaction with the quiz. The main divisions within the page that appear and disappear at different stages of the quiz are:

**Welcome:** This section provides a warm introduction with festive visuals. It features a start button that launches the quiz, setting the tone for a fun and engaging Christmas-themed experience.

**House Rules:** This section provides users with clear and concise instructions on how to play the quiz.

**Quiz:** The core gameplay area includes a progress indicator, the quiz question, multiple-choice answer options, and a 'restart quiz' button for users wishing to play again.

**Results:** Here, users see a summary of their quiz performance, presented in an engaging format such as festive-themed graphics or text descriptions. This section might also include personalized Christmas activity or recipe suggestions based on their answers. Additionally, there's an option to return to the start for those who want to take the quiz again.

There's also a custom 404 error page designed to handle instances where a user lands on a non-existent page. This page includes a link back to index.html, allowing users to easily navigate back to the quiz.

Both the main index.html page and the 404 page feature a non-clickable logo at the top to prevent accidental restarts of the quiz and a footer, including social media links.

#### **Colour & Design**

The Christmas Quiz web application is designed to offer an immersive and festive user experience. The color palette and design elements are carefully chosen to evoke the warmth and joy of the holiday season, ensuring that users feel the Christmas spirit while interacting with the app.

##### **Color Palette**

I have selected a vibrant and harmonious color palette that combines traditional Christmas colors with a touch of elegance and winter charm:

    Classic Red (rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)): A vibrant, warm red that is emblematic of Christmas. Ideal for attention-grabbing elements like buttons, notifications, and progress bars.

    Evergreen Green (rgba(1, 50, 32, 1)): A rich, deep green that reflects the color of Christmas trees. Perfect for background panels and as an accent color in graphics and borders.

    Snowy White (rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)): Crisp and clean, this white brings to mind a serene winter landscape. Used primarily for text and UI elements to ensure readability and a minimalistic, clean aesthetic.

    Gold (rgba(255, 215, 0, 1)): A luxurious and festive gold adds a touch of elegance. It's excellent for highlights, special badges, and to accentuate key information.

    Midnight Blue (rgba(0, 0, 139, 1)): A deep blue reminiscent of a clear winter night's sky, offering a striking contrast to the brighter tones. Suitable for secondary backgrounds and subtle design elements.

##### **Usage of Colors**

* UI Elements: Use Classic Red and Gold for interactive elements like buttons and links to draw attention and guide user interactions.
* Typography: Default text should be in Snowy White for readability, especially on darker backgrounds like Evergreen Green and Midnight Blue.
* Backgrounds: Utilize a combination of Evergreen Green and Midnight Blue for different sections to create depth and visual interest.
* Accents and Highlights: Use Gold sparingly to accentuate important elements and create a festive, premium feel.

##### **Design Principles**

* Simplicity and Clarity: The design should be straightforward, with a focus on user experience and ease of navigation.
* Consistency: Maintain consistent use of colors and design elements throughout the application to create a cohesive look and feel.
* Accessibility: Ensure that text contrasts well against backgrounds for readability and consider accessibility guidelines for a broad range of users.
* Responsiveness: The design should be responsive and adapt well to various screen sizes and devices.

By adhering to these color and design guidelines, an engaging and visually appealing Christmas Quiz experience that captivates our users and spreads holiday cheer will be achieved.
