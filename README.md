## Project Development & Planning
The development of "The Christmas Quiz" was a meticulous process guided by the principles of UX design, including the 5 planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton & Surface. Each stage was carefully executed to create an application that is not only engaging and fun but also intuitive and accessible, fulfilling the needs and expectations of both users and clients.

### Project Goals

#### **Project Purpose**
The Christmas Quiz is a multifaceted project with the primary aim of blending education with entertainment.

The project is a harmonious fusion of engaging content, educational value, and user-centric design, catering to a wide range of users while fulfilling specific educational objectives.


#### **Client Goals**
Although "The Christmas Quiz" was developed as a milestone project for my Diploma in Web Application Development at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), focusing on interactive frontend development and marking my first foray into JavaScript, it did not have a specific external client. To enhance the professionalism of the project and establish a clear scope, I envisioned it as a real-world application that could be ideally suited for festive season promotions, possibly by a family entertainment center, holiday event organizer, or a Christmas-themed website. The hypothetical client's goals would include:
* Engaging users with interactive and enjoyable content related to the Christmas season.
* Educating users about various Christmas traditions, history, and fun facts through an interactive quiz format.
* Enhancing the festive experience of their website visitors, contributing to the holiday spirit.
* Providing a platform that could potentially be used for festive marketing or promotional activities, attracting a wide audience during the holiday season.

#### **User Goals**

The primary audience for "The Christmas Quiz" includes individuals and families who are interested in festive entertainment and eager to learn about Christmas traditions, history, and trivia. This quiz is designed to appeal to a broad range of users, from children to adults, who wish to engage in holiday spirit in an interactive and educational manner. User Goals are:
