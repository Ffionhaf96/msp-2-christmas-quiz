### Accessibility

I ran the site through the [Wave Web Accessibility Evaulation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/). You can [view the full report for the Christmas Quiz site](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://ffionhaf96.github.io/msp-2-christmas-quiz/) I created but I have also included key aspects of the report below.

#### Summary
No error were found and I encountered 4 alerts on initial testing, headers not using <hX> element and suspicious alt text which have been rectified. Manual testing was still encouraged by the WAVE tool.

#### **Accessibility Errors**

#### Possible headings alerts
As mentioned in the summary - 4 alerts were found with citing 3 possible headings that were not using heading elements. 

<details><summary>Possible headings alert</summary>

</details>

#### Suspicious alt text alert on results page
The last alert was aruond suspicious alt text for the images provided on the results page which was rectified by supplying unique alt text for each image via the `alt` key in the `resultsCategory` array in `questions.json`

<details><summary>Suspicious alt text in results.html</summary>

#### Contrast error found in Firefox devtools
Early in development in the `timer` section of the I was using white text on a bright yellow background which failed WCAG standards for accessible text. 
<details><summary>Failed accessible text</summary>
<img src="./docs/images/testing/accessibility/WCAG-contrast-failure.png">
</details>
This was then amended to use a dark green from the sites color pallete which passes the contrast test.

### Performance
I utilized Google Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse to assess the performance of the site.


#### **Lighthouse Results**
<details><summary>Performance Emulation</summary>
All Mobile benchmarks in Chrome Dev Tool's Lighthouse were ran emulating a Moto G Power smartphone using Chromium 120.0.0.0 and a slow 4G network connection.
<img src="/docs/images/testing/performance/lighthose-mobile-simulated-env.png">
</details>

Desktop benchmarks did not have any emualtion applied.

<details><summary>Home Page</summary>
As this was the simplest page it was not particularly difficult to achieve a 100 lighthouse score. There is no data being fetched nor is there any big LCP or CLS to be concerned about because there is no dynamic elements.

## Bugs & Fixes

Throughout the development and testing phases, besides the enhancements mentioned in the validation section above, I came across the following bugs:

- Bug 1 - Storing Array objects directly in localStorage did not work
    - Fix - [Use `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` to store an Array as a string](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3357553/how-do-i-store-an-array-in-localstorage)

- Bug 2 - `chosenAnswers` key needed click event triggered twice to move onto next question
    - Fix - Originally incrementing values with postfix (`index++`) operation which returned value of index and then incremented. Changing to a prefix (`++index`) operation incremented and then returned the value which was intended behaviour.

- Bug 3 - Quiz countdown timer using `setInterval` was not restarting for each new question.
    - Fix: `startTimer()` was being started in two places instead of just one. Changed to start in only one.
    __see__: use `git --no-pager diff c1b48936f188e9c6e8c033edb6d53111fe63f2dc 1759283cac75f9a47233ffbe7f190dc8fde9814b -- game.js` to see the exact fix.

- Bug 4 - Bluring elements for modal to appear only visible by targetting `body` element made everything blurred.
    - Fix: For this I had to find how to select every element that was a `child` of `body` and then not apply a blur to the modal. Luckily there is a property you can access on an element called `child`. This then lead me to Bug 5. 

- Bug 5 - Trying to apply `.classList.add("blur-10");` to each element from `body` using the `child` property did not work.
    - Fix: The `child` property returns a HTMLCollection which is not iterable. So I had to find a way to convert HTMLCollection to an Array. I found a solution on StackOverflow that suggest using `Array.from(HTMLCollection)`. This worked well and enabled me to apply `.classList.add("blur-10");`

- Bug 6 - Passing an argument to function that handles click event made function immediately execute without click event which caused the  e.g. `houseRules.addEventListener('click', handleHouseRules(true)`
    - Fix: Passing the argument to the function via the [`bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) method made the argument available to the function but didn't invoke a function call immediately.
    ![console log showing both true and false arguments being triggered for the same function within 2 milliseconds](FILL IN WITH CONSOLE EPOCH IMG)
