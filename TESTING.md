## Introduction
Welcome to the testing documentation for "The Christmas Quiz". This document provides a comprehensive overview of the various testing methods and procedures employed to ensure the web application is robust, user-friendly, and functions seamlessly across a range of devices and browsers.

The primary objective of these tests is to guarantee that "The Christmas Quiz" delivers an engaging, interactive, and error-free experience to users, aligning with the projectâ€™s goals of educational entertainment and festive enjoyment. The testing process covers a multitude of aspects including functionality, usability, responsiveness, compatibility, and performance.

Each section of this documentation details specific tests conducted, methodologies used, outcomes observed, and any actions taken to address issues or enhance the user experience. By rigorously testing the application, high standards of quality and reliability were upheld, ensuring that "The Christmas Quiz" stands out as a premier choice for users seeking festive-themed interactive content. All the test results detailed below are based on the [deployed site]().

## Automated Checks and Validation

### HTML Validation

I subjected the HTML code of all the pages to validation using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/).

#### **Errors**

#### **HTML Validation Post-Fix**

</details>

### CSS Validation

I validated all CSS code in `style.css` using [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). 


#### **CSS Validation Result**

No validation errors were found. This is likely because VSCode has a [built-in CSS linter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/css#_syntax-verification-linting)

<details><summary>CSS Jigsaw Validation Final Results</summary>
<img src="./docs/images/testing/validation/jigsaw-no-error.png">
</details>


### JavaScript Validation
I used two methods to validate the JavaScript written. Firstly I used ESLint as it is the preffered industry standard for modern JavaScript linting and [integrates into VSCode via the ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) which gives feedback on JavaScript issues in real-time.

[A comparison in package downloads](https://npmcharts.com/compare/jshint,eslint) shows that ESLint has ~32M downloads whereas JSHint has ~400K for the same period. 

<details><summary>Microsoft itself even shows the JSLint extension for VSCode as deprecated</summary>
<img src="./docs/images/testing/validation/JSHint-deprecated.png">
</details>

For the ESlint VSCode extension I used [AirBnB's Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to adhere to good JavaScript practices. This can be seen in the `./assets/js/.eslintrc.js` file. Many issues were automatically flagged and fixed using this such as [no-use-before-define](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-use-before-define) errors where I was calling a function before defining it.

Nevertheless, I also subjected the JavaScript code of all the pages to validation using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) as it was used in previous course example case studies.


<!--> Insert details of any errors or warnings here <-->
#### **JavaScript Validation Pre-Fix**
<details><summary>Missing semicolons in all 3 files</summary>
There were missing semicolons in all my JS files.

</details>

<details><summary>Unused variables in loop forEach loops</summary>
In my forEach loops I was referencing an unused index in two occassions.

</details>

<details><summary>JSHint dot notation</summary>
JSHint picked up on a better style for accessing a property of an element.

### Accessibility

I ran the site through the [Wave Web Accessibility Evaulation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/). You can [view the full report for the Christmas Quiz site](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://ffionhaf96.github.io/msp-2-christmas-quiz/) I created but I have also included key aspects of the report below.

#### Summary
No error were found and I encountered 4 alerts on initial testing, headers not using <hX> element and suspicious alt text which have been rectified. Manual testing was still encouraged by the WAVE tool.

#### **Accessibility Errors**

#### Possible headings alerts
As mentioned in the summary - 4 alerts were found with citing 3 possible headings that were not using heading elements. 

<details><summary>Possible headings alert</summary>
<img src="./docs/images/testing/accessibility/WAVE-game-possible-heading-no-heading-element.png">
</details>

#### Suspicious alt text alert on results page
The last alert was aruond suspicious alt text for the images provided on the results page which was rectified by supplying unique alt text for each image via the `alt` key in the `resultsCategory` array in `questions.json`

<details><summary>Suspicious alt text in results.html</summary>
<img src="./docs/images/testing/accessibility/WAVE-suspicious-alt-text.png">
</details>

#### Contrast error found in Firefox devtools
Early in development in the `timer` section of the I was using white text on a bright yellow background which failed WCAG standards for accessible text. 
<details><summary>Failed accessible text</summary>
<img src="./docs/images/testing/accessibility/WCAG-contrast-failure.png">
</details>
This was then amended to use a dark green from the sites color pallete which passes the contrast test.

### Performance
I utilized Google Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse to assess the performance of the site.


#### **Lighthouse Results**
<details><summary>Performance Emulation</summary>
All Mobile benchmarks in Chrome Dev Tool's Lighthouse were ran emulating a Moto G Power smartphone using Chromium 120.0.0.0 and a slow 4G network connection.
<img src="/docs/images/testing/performance/lighthose-mobile-simulated-env.png">
Desktop benchmarks did not have any emualtion applied.
</details>


<details><summary>Home Page</summary>
As this was the simplest page it was not particularly difficult to achieve a 100 lighthouse score. There is no data being fetched nor is there any big LCP or CLS to be concerned about because there is no dynamic elements.

## Bugs & Fixes

Throughout the development and testing phases, besides the enhancements mentioned in the validation section above, I came across the following bugs:

- Bug 1 - Storing Array objects directly in localStorage did not work
    - Fix - [Use `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` to store an Array as a string](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3357553/how-do-i-store-an-array-in-localstorage)

- Bug 2 - `chosenAnswers` key needed click event triggered twice to move onto next question
    - Fix - Originally incrementing values with postfix (`index++`) operation which returned value of index and then incremented. Changing to a prefix (`++index`) operation incremented and then returned the value which was intended behaviour.

- Bug 3 - Quiz countdown timer using `setInterval` was not restarting for each new question.
    - Fix: `startTimer()` was being started in two places instead of just one. Changed to start in only one.
    __see__: use `git --no-pager diff c1b48936f188e9c6e8c033edb6d53111fe63f2dc 1759283cac75f9a47233ffbe7f190dc8fde9814b -- game.js` to see the exact fix.

- Bug 4 - Bluring elements for modal to appear only visible by targetting `body` element made everything blurred.
    - Fix: For this I had to find how to select every element that was a `child` of `body` and then not apply a blur to the modal. Luckily there is a property you can access on an element called `child`. This then lead me to Bug 5. 

- Bug 5 - Trying to apply `.classList.add("blur-10");` to each element from `body` using the `child` property did not work.
    - Fix: The `child` property returns a HTMLCollection which is not iterable. So I had to find a way to convert HTMLCollection to an Array. I found a solution on StackOverflow that suggest using `Array.from(HTMLCollection)`. This worked well and enabled me to apply `.classList.add("blur-10");`

- Bug 6 - Passing an argument to function that handles click event made function immediately execute without click event which caused the  e.g. `houseRules.addEventListener('click', handleHouseRules(true)`
    - Fix: Passing the argument to the function via the [`bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) method made the argument available to the function but didn't invoke a function call immediately.
